Threading works best at recursion depth 5 and anti-aliasing 4, I dont think I was able to set threading off, so its always threading and thats why many objects segfault when traced.

I was not able to do much for cube map, juct played around with methods and am not sure yet what i'm supposed to do with it.

No kd-tree and no artifacts are done.

the rest of the project works well if threading is commented out.
